# Extended Training Sweep Note

This benchmark-local note is stored at `/root/rd6_training_sweep_note.md` and defines bounded reviewer-side experiment bookkeeping after the primary training run. The bookkeeping artifact is written to `/root/rd6_training_sweep_trace.json` and must preserve structured loop evidence rather than a marker string.

sweep_mode=looped
target_artifact=results.json
